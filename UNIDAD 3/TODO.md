# TODO List for Enhancing Interactive Integral Calculator

## Step 1: Improve Design of index.html
- [x] Add Bootstrap CSS for responsive design.
- [x] Style the form with better layout, colors, and typography.
- [x] Ensure the toggle functionality for triple integrals is enhanced.

## Step 2: Improve Design of resultado.html
- [x] Add Bootstrap CSS for consistent styling.
- [x] Display the result in a more visually appealing way.
- [x] Add a back button with better styling.

## Step 3: Add Graphing Functionality to app.py
- [x] Install necessary libraries (e.g., numpy, plotly).
- [x] Modify the resolver route to generate a plot of the integral function.
- [x] For double integrals, create a 3D surface plot.
- [x] For triple integrals, create a 3D volume plot.

## Step 4: Integrate Graph Display in Templates
- [x] Update resultado.html to display the generated graph (embed Plotly chart).
- [x] Ensure the graph is interactive.

## Step 5: Test the Application
- [x] Run the app and test both double and triple integral calculations.
- [x] Verify the graphs display correctly.
- [x] Check responsiveness on different screen sizes.
